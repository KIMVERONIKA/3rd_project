# The 3nd team project. Data-Analysis-Facebook

## Objective/Goal
The project targeted marketing ads on facebook.
Our task is to build a model of machine learning that will predict a person will click on the advertisement or not on Facebook.


## Role
We worked independently for 1 month for our 3rd team project to extract, clean, analyze, visualize, create model with diffrent classifier and fit the models.

## Data
This dataset consists total of a 499 answers.
number of customers who clicked on ad =  250,
percentage clicked =  50.1 %,
did not click =  249,
persentage who did not click =  49.9 %.

## Tools Used
MeanMedianImputer, CategoricalImputer, RobustScaler, LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder, SklearnTransformerWrapper, EqualWidthDiscretiser, Pipeline, GridSearchCV

## Models Used

1.NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFICATION, 

2.BAGGING CLASSIFICATION, 

3.K-NEIGHBORS CLASSIFICATION, 

4.RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFICATION, 

5.LOGISTIC REGRESSION, 

6.SUPER LEANER
